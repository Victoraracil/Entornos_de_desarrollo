/**
 * Create a program called VideoGameList.java to store objects of
 * a class called VideoGame that you must define. For each videogame,
 * we are going to store its title, genere and price.
 * Add also the corresponding getters, setters and constructor to set these values.
 * Define a main, public class called VideoGameList in the same source file.
 * Then, in the main method of this class, create an array of 5 video games,
 * ask the user to fill de information of each videogame,
 * and then show the title of the cheapest and the most expensive video game of the array
 *
 * Improve exercise VideoGameList.java from previous document in another source file
 * called VideoGameList2.java. Now, every video game has a Company that created it.
 * For every company, we need to store its name and the foundation year.
 * Associate a company to each video game, so that some video games
 * can share the same company object. Then, modify the main application
 * to specify the company information for every videogame (besides video game initial data).
 * Make sure that you share the same Company object among all the video games
 * belonging to the same company.
 *
 * Improve previous exercise VideoGameList2.java in another
 * source file called VideoGameList3.java.
 * Add a new class called PCVideoGame which inherits from VideoGame class.
 * It will have two new attributes called minimumRAM and minimumHD to
 * store the minimum amount of RAM memory and hard disk space required
 * to play the game (both integers). Define the corresponding constructor
 * to set these values (and use super to call parentâ€™s constructor to set
 * the inherited values).
 * Then, add some PC video games to the array and repeat the same steps
 * as in previous exercise.
 *
 * Also override toString method in VideoGame class so that we can print
 * a video game in the screen with its information
 * by symply calling System.out.println
